        Hey There Welcome üëã,
        <br><br>
I hope this post finds you well. Recently I formed a team of 6 members under the guidance of Prof. Amar Nayak Sir for the #kavach2023 hackathon. I described the #usecase diagram for our solution dated 15th April 2023.
<br><br>
üéØ : We will focus to design and develop an effective #ai_enabled phishing links detection and alert system, our team will need to leverage the latest technological advancements and techniques. This solution should be capable of detecting the source of phishing attacks in a variety of contexts, including web pages, email apps, social media, instant messenger apps, text messages, and more.
Our goal is to create a solution that is user-friendly and accessible, regardless of whether it is delivered as a desktop/mobile application or a web browser plugin. To achieve this, we will need to prioritize the development of a user-friendly interface, as well as a powerful backend system that can quickly and accurately identify phishing attempts.
Our team will work closely with clients to understand their specific needs and requirements, ensuring that the solution we develop is tailored to their unique situation. Through a collaborative and iterative design process, we will create a solution that is effective, efficient, and easy to use.
Overall, our focus will be on delivering a solution that provides reliable, real-time alerts to users, empowering them to take action and protect themselves against phishing attacks. With the right technology and approach, we believe we can create an effective AI-enabled phishing links detection and alert system that helps clients safeguard their online security.
